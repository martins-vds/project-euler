# Sum square difference

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

![1^2+2^2+...+10^2=385](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?1^2&plus;2^2&plus;...&plus;10^2=385)

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

![(1+2+...+10)^2=55^2=3025](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?(1&plus;2&plus;...&plus;10)^2=55^2=3025)

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is

![3025-385](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?3025-385)

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
